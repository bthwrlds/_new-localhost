          Hello World!
          This is my portfolio website. It's based on my first website that I've build during my work.
          I hadnt had any specific tasks, so I decided to practice working with html and scss.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea for this website was mainly, to try out the things that I've learned so far. For presenting it as my
          portofolio I took some more changes. My goal was to create
          a website, that I would like to create for my own portofolio and that presents my sense of style and humor.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main inspiration for webdesign are early 2010-Myspace websites. It was the first time that I got in touch
          with html. I mostly enjoyed working around the restrictions, MySpace was trying to set. Putting music on
          auto-play when loading the page and hiding the stop-button of the player was pure joy for me. (eventhough
          none of my friends would visit my page any more)
        </p>
