          Hello World!
          This is my portfolio website. It's based on my first website that I've build for myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea for this website was mainly to try out the things that I've learned so far. For presenting it as my
          portofolio I took some more changes. My goal was to create
          a website, my own portofolio which presents my sense of style and humor.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main inspiration for webdesign are early 2010-Myspace websites. It was the first time that I got in touch
          with html. I mostly enjoyed working around the restrictions MySpace was trying to set: putting music on
          auto-play when loading the page and hiding the stop-button of the player was joy for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise I try to focus on simple design elements combined with playfullness. After studying more about
          webdesign and coding I started to like the inbuild styles, fonts and colors in html, rather than picking more
          specific styling.
        </p>
